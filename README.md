# Send To Archive Browser Extension
Saves the current page to the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/web).

Before using this, consider these from the horse's mouth: 

* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/
* If you see something, save something: https://blog.archive.org/2017/01/25/see-something-save-something/

This add-on is different from the one offered by the Internet Archive:

1. It requires one click instead of two
2. The new tab with the internet archive is not activated (you stay on the current page)
3. It offers no functionality to find older versions of a wegpage
4. It doesn't do any 404 or other checking at all
