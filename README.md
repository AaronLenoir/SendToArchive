# Send To Archive Browser Extension
Saves the current page to the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/web).

Before using this, consider these from the horse's mouth: 

* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/
* If you see something, save something: https://blog.archive.org/2017/01/25/see-something-save-something/

This add-on is slightly different from the one offered by the Internet Archive:

1. It requires one click instead of two
2. The new tab with the internet archive is not activated
3. It offers no functionality to find older versions of a wegpage
