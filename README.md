# Send To Archive Browser Extension
Saves the current page to the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/web).

This add-on is different from the one offered by the Internet Archive:

1. It requires one click instead of two
2. The new tab with the internet archive is not activated (you stay on the current page)
3. It offers no functionality to find older versions of a wegpage
4. It doesn't do any 404 or other checking at all

As of version 2 you can also right-click a link and save it directly.

If this doesn't rock your boat, try these extensions instead:

* If you see something, save something: https://blog.archive.org/2017/01/25/see-something-save-something/
